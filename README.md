After looking into some projects online, I think the best granularity is zipcode. I uploaded a python file to extract the useful columns, and 3 datasets concerning the income, population and housing price of certain zipcode zones, and finally a zipcode map.


## crime couts
The final result is in \crimedata\crime counts.csv. If you want to repreduce the result, please run *crime_clean.R* first to get the cleaned crime data and the run *crime-zip.R*.
